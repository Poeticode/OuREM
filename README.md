# ourem

A little cross-platform Flutter app that will help you catalogue your dreams.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view the online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## TODO
* Ability to edit/delete entries.
* Option to encrypt all dream entries with a password or fingerprint.
* Real-time voice-to-text because no one wants to type out a long dream on a phone.
* Add tags/categories to entries.
* Add a bunch of sounds/alarms that are known to be easy to recognize in dreams.
* Set an alarm with one of the said sounds/alarms that only plays for a short duration.
* Hook up to the Oura Ring Cloud API, and visualize that data.
